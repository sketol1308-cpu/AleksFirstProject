## Your Files Are Ready!

I've prepared everything for you:
- ✅ `D:\Alex\itgenio\Projects\index.html` - Your main website file (upload this!)
- ✅ The file has all features: dark mode, search, filters, image cropper, etc.

## Troubleshooting

**Site not loading?**
- Wait a few minutes (can take up to 10 minutes first time)
- Make sure the file is named exactly `index.html` (lowercase)
- Check that your repository is Public, not Private

**Want a custom domain like AleksFirstProject.com?**
- After GitHub Pages is working, you can buy a domain
- Then add it in Settings > Pages > Custom domain
